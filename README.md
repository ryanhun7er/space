## Usage 
​
In order to ensure this code can be viewed correctly, it must be viewed in a web browser, ideally Google Chrome as it has the best compatibility. You can do this using the following link: https://ryanhun7er.github.io/space/. The user can choose from a list of nine planets* that are in a dropdown menu and clicking button "sear". The carousel will change from a picture of the galaxy to the current planet selected. Information will be shown on each side of the carousel about the selected planets.

## Credits
​
The instructor and TA's of VU's coding bootcamp. Seriously though.

Feel free to make this better. It's like Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, nothing is original. Take an axe for example, you're not going to reinvent the axe. However, you can always leave it sharper than when you found it.
